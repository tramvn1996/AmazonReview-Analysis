# Amazon Review

Using Spark in Python to find out what categories of stuff have the best review on Amazon

According to the result, there are exactly 507 categories with 5-star review. However, these categories are not
on the popular side, so there are not variation to consider. 

To find out what is the most reliable categories to shop from Amazon, I will sort the count column to get the highest count, 
and then sort the average column (total) to get the highest reviewed categories.
